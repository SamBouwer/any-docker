# any-docker
Dockerized all-in-one instance of an anytype node

Aim: to provide a simple to use all-in-one docker image that runs a Anytype node and required infrastructure.

* mongodo4.4
* minio
* redis
* any-sync-tool
* any-sync-coordinator
* any-sync-node
* any-sync-filenode

I'm building a Dockerfile based on the instructions as posted here: https://tech.anytype.io/how-to/self-hosting

As building Anytype nodes and clients from source for selfhosting is new, and I am personally new to building docker images, any help is welcome!

Note that I am not part of the Anytype team.
